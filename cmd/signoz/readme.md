## SigNoz vs Jaeger
- Jaeger only does distributed tracing.
- SigNoz does both metrics and traces, and we also have log management in our roadmap.
- SigNoz has few more advanced features:
  - Jaegar UI doesn’t show any metrics on traces or on filtered traces
  - Jaeger can’t get aggregates on filtered traces. For example, p99 latency of requests which have tag - customer_type='premium'. This can be done easily on SigNoz
